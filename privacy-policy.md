# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 31, 2025**

## Overview

Mech Keeb Switches ("the App") is a mechanical keyboard switch reference application. Your privacy is important to us, and we want to be transparent: this App collects virtually no data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

The App operates entirely on your device. Your favorites, inventory data, and preferences are stored locally and never leave your device.

## Network Usage

The App downloads switch images from our content delivery network (CDN) for display purposes. These requests are standard HTTPS requests and do not include any personal identifiers. Once downloaded, images are cached locally on your device.

**No analytics, tracking, or telemetry data is collected or transmitted.**

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Storage
Switch catalog data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted anywhere.
Your personal data (favorites and inventory quantities) is synced across your devices using Apple's iCloud service. This data is stored in your private iCloud container, which means:

- Apple manages the iCloud sync service and infrastructure.
- The developer **cannot** see, access, or retrieve your favorites or inventory data.
- **Only you** can access this data through your iCloud account.
- You can delete this data by removing the app or managing your iCloud storage.

This data is also included in your device backups and can be deleted by uninstalling the App.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
