# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 25, 2024**

## Overview

Mech Keeb Switches ("the App") is a mechanical keyboard switch reference application. Your privacy is important to us, and we want to be transparent: this App collects virtually no data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

The App operates entirely on your device. Your favorites, inventory data, and preferences are stored locally and never leave your device.

## Network Usage

The App downloads switch images from our content delivery network (CDN) for display purposes. These requests are standard HTTPS requests and do not include any personal identifiers. Once downloaded, images are cached locally on your device.

**No analytics, tracking, or telemetry data is collected or transmitted.**

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Storage

All user data (favorites, inventory, preferences) is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms. This data is included in your device backups and can be deleted by uninstalling the App.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
